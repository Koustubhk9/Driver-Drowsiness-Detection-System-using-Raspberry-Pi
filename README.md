-This project presents a real-time driver drowsiness detection system developed using Raspberry Pi, OpenCV, and machine learning techniques. The system is designed to monitor a driver's eye and facial movements to identify signs of fatigue and drowsiness. Once detected, it triggers an alert to prevent potential accidents, contributing to enhanced road safety.



Objective:-

-To develop a low-cost, compact, and efficient system capable of continuously tracking driver alertness and issuing real-time warnings when signs of drowsiness are detected.



Key Features:-

-Real-time eye and face monitoring using computer vision

-Automatic alert activation on detecting prolonged eye closure

-Compact implementation using Raspberry Pi

-Touchscreen interface for ease of use and interaction

-Operates as a standalone embedded system without needing external hardware



Technologies Used:-

-Raspberry Pi

-Python

-OpenCV

-Touchscreen display
